      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
<p>
Hi, I'm Rorisang üë©üèΩ‚Äçüíª<br>
I'm a Software Developer with 3+ years of experience working in both startup and enterprise environments. I‚Äôve contributed to full-stack web and mobile apps, fixed critical system issues, and played a key role in award-winning solutions.
I‚Äôve built with tools like Flutter, Firebase, Node.js, SQL, and Power Platform. I enjoy solving real-world problems through clean code, automation, and smart UI experiences.<br><br>
I started my career at a fast-paced startup (TopCode), where I was trusted with full responsibility across both frontend and backend projects. It shaped how I learn fast, work independently, and adapt quickly. I‚Äôm now looking for my next opportunity where I can grow the same way while contributing meaningfully to a team.
<br>
 <b>Why I Value Startup Experience</b> <br>
At TopCode, a fast-paced startup, I was often thrown into real-world client projects with full responsibility, from mobile apps to WordPress sites. I built and deployed production apps, troubleshot issues others couldn‚Äôt solve, and delivered entire websites end-to-end.
That startup environment shaped my ability to work independently, learn fast, and ship real value under pressure something I‚Äôm now looking to expand in new, growth-focused roles.</p>
