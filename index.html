      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I’m Rorisang Kgwete, a versatile developer with a strong background in both full-stack coding and low-code development. I specialize in building efficient digital solutions using the Microsoft Power Platform, Dynamics 365, and automation tools like Power Automate (Cloud & Desktop). My career started with frontend and mobile development using Flutter, JavaScript, and Node.js, and has grown into delivering business-focused apps, workflows, dashboards, and integrated solutions. I also mentor junior developers on Power Platform delivery.
